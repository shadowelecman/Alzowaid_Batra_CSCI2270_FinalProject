For our final project, Rowan Alzowaid and I will build upon Assignment 12 movies with hash tables. We plan to create a new and more robust algorithm for generating hashcodes for storing movies in the hash table. In addition, we want to expand the functionality of the hash table by adding new ways of searching for movies. A few examples include finding a movie by its year of release, showing a saga when searching for a particular movie within that saga, showing movies by their language, etc. The ultimate goal is to create a search system similar to that of a movie website in which their are multiple options available to the user for finding the movie he/she is looking for.
